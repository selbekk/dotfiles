# My funky dotfiles

Putting your dotfiles (config files etc) and important scripts in a 
repository is a good idea.

Honestly, this is a pretty standard set up, with a few tweaks to fit my 
work flow. Feel free to get inspired, and if you have any good tips,
     feel free to send me a pull request.
